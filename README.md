# Cats Vs Dogs Web App

This is the backend to a web app for predicting whether an image is a cat or a dog.

It uses https://github.com/jjbuck/CatsVsDogsInfrastructure as a starting point, which is generated from a generic template I created (https://github.com/jjbuck/FargateServiceInfrastructure).

The front end of this web app is http://jonathanjbuck.com/cats-vs-dogs/index.html.
